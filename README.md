### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luis Miguel from Peru. I'm Big Data Engineer and also a Data Analyst but with a strong interest in Data Science which is a fun stuff. I've found in sharing what I'm learning a motivation, and this is the main focus on my GitHub repos: I believe that everyone can contribute to the community by sharing our knowledge and experiences.

##Â My passions:
- Programming and Data
- Sharing content
- Helping other developers like me

## On my GitHub you may find different repos from 4 main branches:

- Data Engineering: these repos are focus on projects with many different tools that helps us to create data pipelines/workflows with batch/streaming processing and even using the cloud! (prefix for these repos names: 'de').
- Data Science: if you want to learn different types of ML/DL algorithms, you can find them here. A very good to learn new things is by putting in practice, so you will se some notebooks with the explanation of those concepts in Data Science. I don't have too much experience on that but I'm making my whole effort for this. (prefix for these repos names: 'ds').
- Data Analysis: if you are focusing on this branch or specialization, you will find some exercises, challenges (from the Internet) and examples of how to analyze data to get the insights. (prefix for these repos names: 'da').
- Cheat Sheets: this repo is just focus on sharing the most common syntaxis (and examples) of different programming languages (not only for data processing) that I learned over the years. I pretty sure that it will be helpful for you!

Right know, I started to learn new thing in theses branches, and of course I will share them to you!
